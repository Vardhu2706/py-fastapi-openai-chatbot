```

For Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

For Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI development server:
```bash
cd app
python main.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage
